Description
---

A sample app using the ordnancesurvey-ios-sdk to demonstrate Overlays.

The app is a game with the objective being to find all the overlays that are created at random locations on the map and then remove each overlay by tapping on them until none remain

Getting started
---

#### Requirements

This project requires the following points are met:

- Minimum iOS version: 6.0.1
- Xcode version: 4.5.2
- iOS Openspace SDK version: TBC


### Register for an API Key

Developers who wish to use the online services will need to register for an API key in order to authenticate requests.

When registering for an API Key we need to know a couple of items:

* Bundle Identifier of the application using the API key

Let us know the Bundle Identifier of the Xcode project in which you will be using the API. This is available and configurable when creating an Xcode project or from project settings or `Info.plist`


* Apple App ID to be associated with this application

This ID is the unique Apple ID generated in iTunes Connect when creating a new iOS application for the Apple AppStore



### Registration Process

If you do not own a re-use data licence you can register for an API key to access [OS OpenSpace Pro] (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/web-services/os-openspace/pro/index.html) under a 90 day trial or a commercial re-use licence. 

If you own a data licence, for example, you are a member of the PSMA, you can register for an API key to access [OSOnDemand WMTS] (http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/web-services/os-ondemand/pricing.html).

#### Download project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/ios-sdk-demo-overlay-finder.git

- Unzip the SDK into the `StaticFrameworks` directory at the root of the project

<pre>
$SRCROOT/StaticFrameworks
</pre>
 

#### Update demo app with your API Key and Bundle Identifier details

Copy and paste the API Key into the demo app

Update the Bundle Identifier associated with the API Key

```objective-c
//In MapViewController.m

static NSString *const kOSApiKey = @"YOUR_KEY_HERE";
static BOOL const kOSIsPro = YES;

```

#### Build and run

Project can now be built and run. Have fun!
